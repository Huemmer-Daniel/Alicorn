# Alicorn

*Dynamically define and manipulate physical units and quantities in Julia*

The Alicorn package serves a dual purpose:
1. Dynamically define and combine physical units based on the
   [International System of Units (SI)](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/).
   This functionality is provided by the `Units` submodule.
2. Handle physical quantities and correctly treat their units. This
   functionality is provided by the `Quantities` submodule.
